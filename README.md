# Spotify-website-clone
 Goal is to recreate the iconic and user-friendly homepage of Spotify, one of the world's most popular music streaming platforms. By mimicking Spotify's design and functionality, we aim to provide users with a familiar and seamless experience that closely resembles the real thing.
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and reset their passwords, just like on the actual Spotify website.
Dynamic Content: Real-time updates to display popular tracks, top artists, and trending playlists.
Search Functionality: A powerful search feature that allows users to find their favorite artists, albums, tracks, and playlists.
